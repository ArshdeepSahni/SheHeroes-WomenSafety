#### Inspiration
Considering the safety and security of women in India in the recent times, We wanted to give a try from our end to address the issue in a simpler and safer way.

Looking at the recent trends and the most powerful weapon with the humanity - technology, we planned to use the same to give access to women in serious or dangerous situations to address the issue in a fast and easier way to ensure their security.

#### Features
We are working on providing an app for women which analyses the user location and surroundings and with a little input of behavioural analysis, we can estimate the probability of a women to be in a safe environment or prone to be under threat. Extra features like SOS, Instant recording, police siren(to drive away the danger), booking cabs and custom shake which user can a functionality to be available at hand.

Women Safety App constantly shares the userâ€™s location to the backend where the backend analyzes if the user is presently in a dense area or is alone in a very less populated zone or in an unused area via the google traffic analysing API.

Contains a dashboard that contains all the important Action Buttons like SOS, InstantRecorder, Police Siren, Instant image capture,nearby police stations, instant Taxi/Cab booking, and most important a custom shake button to alert the application to automatically perform the emergency tasks while in danger.

In the event the user doesnt give consent for their location being monitored, the app just functions as a safety and self defence app with various protections features which can make the app in action either on rapid shake while in emergency or by custom use by the user.

While focusing on the idea for future developments, we want to proceed with WatchOS application as wearables are the near future and the technology is easily available at hand for users. Though we faced time and technical constraints at the moment, we are still optimistically moving towards the same for which we also started for working on the prototype.
